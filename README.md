# Real World RL in Deployment

The repository compiles real-world applications of reinforcement learning.
- Only include methods that was deployed, is currently deployed, or will be deployed in the future. 
- Exclude RL applications to games and robotics. 
- Only include publicly available information. 

The repository aggregates information from several sources, including
- [DeepRLInTheWorld](https://github.com/montrealrobotics/DeepRLInTheWorld)
- [RL for real-world problems](https://mighty-melody-f4b.notion.site/RL-for-real-world-problems-0114c270e5d94894b3c4f227e24401db)
- [Application of RL 2023](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bJssDePYLuVHSHoBAPYaiIjXcLFB0hOsuR1-PXtEb-o/edit#slide=id.g1d05b5b4042_462_15)

We categorize RL production based on the deployment status (e.g., currently deployed, deployed at least once/for some time, planned to be deployed, or unknown)
and the approaches to solve the problems (e.g., online, offline, build a simulator then planning, build a simulator then search, offline data with partial simulator).
